# Relation

> A small, declarative ORM layer over the [database](database.md) module: name a table's relations once, then `load` / `find` records with their related rows already attached. Loading is **batched** — one query per relation across the whole record set (`where(col).any(keys)`), grouped in memory and merged on — so a hundred parents cost the same number of round-trips as one. Five relation kinds (`belongs` / `many` / `one` / `through` / `morph`) cover the FK shapes; nested includes recurse through the registry; `link` / `unlink` / `links` manage a many-to-many junction without hand-writing join rows.
>
> It deliberately stays **thin above the typed store**. Resolution is define-time (each relation is precomputed once into a flat `ResolvedRelation` — nothing is inferred while loading), and the loaded relation properties are intentionally **loose** (`Row | readonly Row[] | undefined`) rather than typed to each exact target row: the typed half is the table reached through `model.table`; relation loading is the looser convenience on top. No write-cascades, no lazy proxies, no query builder of its own — just batched eager loading and junction management. Source: [`src/core`](../../src/core). Surfaced through the `@src/core` barrel.

## Surface

Create a manager over a database and its relation map, then reach a typed model and load with relations attached:

```ts
import { createRelationManager, belongsTo, hasMany, hasThrough } from '@orkestrel/relation'

const manager = createRelationManager({
	database: db, // a typed DatabaseInterface from createDatabase(...)
	relations: {
		accounts: {
			classification: belongsTo('classificationId', 'classifications'), // FK on accounts → one classification
			contacts: hasMany('accountId'), // FK on contacts → many contacts back here
			representatives: hasThrough('accountReps', 'accountId', 'repId', 'representatives'), // many-to-many via a junction
		},
		contacts: { account: belongsTo('accountId', 'accounts') }, // so contacts can nest-load its account
	},
})

const accounts = manager.model('accounts') // a typed Model; only the relations you asked for are loaded
const acme = await accounts.load('acc1', { contacts: true, classification: true })

acme?.name // ✅ the base row is the table's row type
acme?.contacts // the relation property — broad (Row | readonly Row[] | undefined); narrow at the use site
```

`model(name)` is checked against the database's declared tables, so a typo is a compile error. The model's own table (`model.table`) carries that table's row type; the attached related rows are the broad `Row` — narrow them where you read them.

## Methods

The public methods of each behavioral interface — one table per type, keyed by its backticked name, every call-signature member listed (its `readonly` data members, e.g. `emitter` / `name` / `table` / `relations` / `count`, stay in the Surface rows above — `Model`'s `emitter` is the typed push observation surface, see [Observing](#observing)). `Model` and `RelationManager` each implement their interface exactly, so this doubles as the per-instance method surface (AGENTS §22).

#### `ModelInterface`

`load` / `find` batch-load (one query per relation regardless of result size); `link` / `unlink` / `links` manage a `through` relation's junction rows.

| Method   | Returns                                      | Behavior                                                  |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `load`   | `Promise<Loaded<T> \| undefined>` (or array) | One record by key(s) with the chosen relations populated. |
| `find`   | `Promise<readonly Loaded<T>[]>`              | Many records (paged / sorted) with relations populated.   |
| `link`   | `Promise<void>`                              | Insert a junction row for a `through` relation.           |
| `unlink` | `Promise<void>`                              | Remove a junction row for a `through` relation.           |
| `links`  | `Promise<readonly Key[]>`                    | The related keys reachable through a `through` relation.  |

#### `RelationManagerInterface`

Follows the manager accessor pattern (`model` singular, `models` plural).

| Method   | Returns                       | Behavior                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `model`  | `ModelInterface<RowOf<T[K]>>` | The typed model for a declared table.    |
| `models` | `readonly string[]`           | The names of every model with relations. |
| `has`    | `boolean`                     | Whether a model has resolved relations.  |

## Contract

These invariants hold across `src/core` ↔ `relation.md`:

1. **DOC ↔ SOURCE bijection.** Every `function` / `class` / `interface` / `type` row in the `## Surface` tables is a real export of the relations source tree, and every export appears as a Surface row — exhaustive, both directions (AGENTS §22).
2. **Layered on the typed database.** A manager is built over a `DatabaseInterface`; `model(name)` is checked against the database's declared tables and returns a model whose `table` is that table's typed `TableInterface` (a declared table with no relation entry yields a relation-less model — still fully usable for typed CRUD). Related tables are fetched by runtime name at the broad `Row` type — the load layer is deliberately loose above the typed store, and a relation pointing at a missing table fails the first time that relation loads, not at construction.
3. **Batch loading — no N+1.** For each included relation, one query fetches the related rows for the entire record set (`where(col).any(keys)` over the distinct foreign keys); they are grouped in memory and attached. The cost is one query per relation, independent of how many parents were loaded. Nested includes recurse through the registry, so a loaded relation carries its own loaded relations — each nested level is again one batched query.
4. **Resolution is define-time.** Each raw `Relation` is resolved once at construction into a flat `ResolvedRelation`; nothing is inferred during loading. The builders set an explicit `relationship` (so `many` and `one`, otherwise identical as `{ key }`, are unambiguous); a hand-written descriptor with no `relationship` infers one from the fields present (`through` → `through`, `tag` → `morph`, `column` → `belongs`, else `key` → `one`), and a malformed one throws `INVALID` at define-time.
5. **Total, loose `Loaded`.** `Loaded<T>` is the base row (the table's row type) intersected with the broad relation bag `Readonly<RelationProps>` (`Row | readonly Row[] | undefined` per relation); a missed `belongs` / `one` is `undefined`, a missed `many` / `through` / `morph` is `[]`. Through-only operations (`link` / `unlink` / `links`) throw `NOT_THROUGH` on any other kind and `UNKNOWN_RELATION` for a relation the model never declared.
6. **Observation is a pure side-channel (§13).** A `Model` owns a typed `emitter` (`ModelEventMap` — `load(name, count)` / `link(key, relation)` / `unlink(key, relation)`); `RelationManager` is event-free by design (a stateless registry has no observable lifecycle). Every event is emitted directly (the AGENTS §13 convention: the emitter isolates a listener throw, routing it to its OWN `error` handler — the `error` option, surfaced as `(error, event)`, NOT a domain event — itself re-entrancy-guarded) strictly AFTER the load resolves / the junction op completes. `load` fires ONCE per relation (carrying the count of rows attached across the record set — no N+1 in the events), so a buggy observer can corrupt neither the batched eager-load nor a junction write (proven by the emit-safety tests).
7. **DOC ↔ SOURCE method bijection.** Every behavioral interface's `## Methods` table lists exactly its public methods (call-signature members) — exhaustive, both directions — and each implementing class (`Model` / `RelationManager`) exposes the same public methods, no more (AGENTS §22). A renamed / added / removed method breaks the gate until the table is reconciled.

Typing each loaded relation property to its exact target row (Prisma-style) is a deliberate, documented deferral — like the database guide's deferred pieces. The `Model` is now **observable** — it owns a typed `emitter` (`ModelEventMap`, §13) carrying its eager-load + junction moments (see [Observing](#observing)); `RelationManager` stays event-free by design (a stateless registry that merely vends models has no observable lifecycle of its own). Still out of scope: write-cascades; they are additive and leave the surface above unchanged.

## Patterns

### Defining relations

```ts
import {
	createRelationManager,
	belongsTo,
	hasMany,
	hasOne,
	hasThrough,
	hasMorph,
} from '@orkestrel/relation'

const manager = createRelationManager({
	database: db,
	relations: {
		accounts: {
			classification: belongsTo('classificationId', 'classifications'), // FK on accounts
			contacts: hasMany('accountId'), // FK on contacts → accounts
			profile: hasOne('accountId', 'profiles'), // single, FK on profiles
			representatives: hasThrough('accountReps', 'accountId', 'repId', 'representatives'), // via junction
			notes: hasMorph('entityId', 'entityType', 'account', 'notes'), // polymorphic
		},
		contacts: { account: belongsTo('accountId', 'accounts') },
	},
})
```

Two shorthands cover the common kinds — a bare string is a `belongsTo` column, and a one-element array is a `hasMany` key (both unambiguous, so they need no `relationship`):

```ts
relations: { accounts: { classification: 'classificationId', contacts: ['accountId'] } }
```

Reach for the builders for everything else: they set an explicit `relationship`, which is what disambiguates `many` from `one` (a raw `{ key }` descriptor infers `one`).

The relation kinds, and where each foreign key lives:

| Kind      | Builder      | FK location    | Returns               |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------- | --------------------- |
| `belongs` | `belongsTo`  | THIS table     | single or `undefined` |
| `many`    | `hasMany`    | RELATED table  | array                 |
| `one`     | `hasOne`     | RELATED table  | single or `undefined` |
| `through` | `hasThrough` | junction table | array                 |
| `morph`   | `hasMorph`   | RELATED table  | array                 |

### Resolving relations directly

`resolveRelation` / `resolveRelationMap` / `isRelationDescriptor` are what `createRelationManager` calls internally to turn a raw `RelationMap` into `ResolvedRelation`s at construction — reach for them directly when validating a relation map before wiring a manager, or when testing a descriptor's inferred `relationship`:

```ts
import { isRelationDescriptor, resolveRelation, resolveRelationMap } from '@orkestrel/relation'

const resolved = resolveRelation('classification', belongsTo('classificationId', 'classifications'))
resolved.relationship // 'belongs'

const map = resolveRelationMap({ contacts: hasMany('accountId') })
map.get('contacts')?.relationship // 'many'

isRelationDescriptor(belongsTo('classificationId')) // true — the object form
```

Catch a malformed relation with `isRelationError`, branching on its machine-readable `code`:

```ts
import { isRelationError } from '@orkestrel/relation'

try {
	resolveRelation('bad', {})
} catch (error) {
	if (isRelationError(error)) error.code // 'INVALID'
}
```

### The registry surface

Beyond `model(name)`, a `RelationManager` exposes `models()` (every table name with resolved relations) and `has(name)` (whether a given table has any):

```ts
manager.models() // e.g. ['accounts', 'contacts']
manager.has('accounts') // true
manager.has('unrelated_table') // false
```

### Loading

`load` mirrors the table's keyed-read overload: a single key returns one record (or `undefined`), an array of keys returns a positional array of records (each slot `undefined` for a missing key) — and either way the relation queries are batched in one pass. `find` runs the table's query (sorted / paged) and attaches relations to the page.

```ts
const accounts = manager.model('accounts')

// One record, with the chosen relations attached:
const acme = await accounts.load('acc1', { contacts: true, classification: true })

// Many records — sorted and paged — with relations attached to the page:
const page = await accounts.find(
	{ representatives: true },
	{ sort: 'name', direction: 'ascending', limit: 10 },
)

// Nested includes — load a relation's own relations (recurses through the registry):
const deep = await accounts.load('acc1', { contacts: { account: true } })

// Batch by key array: an array in, an array out — and the relation fetch is STILL
// one query per relation across all parents (no N+1), not one per key.
const [a, b] = await accounts.load(['acc1', 'acc2'], { contacts: true })
```

### Typed table access

For writes and plain queries, drop through to `model.table` — the full typed `TableInterface` for that model's table. This is the typed half; eager loading is the looser convenience layered on it.

```ts
const accounts = manager.model('accounts')
await accounts.table.set({ id: 'acc4', name: 'New Corp', classificationId: 'cls1' }) // fully typed
await accounts.table.query().where('name').starts('A').all()
```

### Through management

A `through` relation's junction rows are managed by key — no need to model the junction table yourself or hand-write join rows. `link` / `unlink` / `links` resolve the relation's junction table + its source/target columns from the define-time `ResolvedRelation`, and throw `NOT_THROUGH` if pointed at a non-`through` relation.

```ts
await accounts.link('acc1', 'representatives', 'rep3') // insert a junction row (accountId=acc1, repId=rep3)
await accounts.unlink('acc1', 'representatives', 'rep1') // remove the matching junction row(s)
const repIds = await accounts.links('acc1', 'representatives') // the related keys reachable via the junction
```

### Observing

Each `Model` exposes a typed `emitter` (AGENTS §13) carrying its eager-load + junction moments for fire-and-forget observers — logging, metrics, a sync layer. Subscribe via `model.emitter.on(...)`. **Emitting is observation-only**: every event fires strictly AFTER the load resolves / the junction op completes, so a listener can never change what a load does (and a throwing one can't corrupt it). The `RelationManager` is event-free by design — a stateless registry that merely vends models has no observable lifecycle of its own; observe the per-model handle instead.

```ts
const accounts = manager.model('accounts')
accounts.emitter.on('load', (name, count) => metrics.record(`relation.${name}`, count))
accounts.emitter.on('link', (key, relation) => sync.push(key, relation))
```

The event vocabulary:

| Entity  | Event map       | Events                                                                |
| ------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Model` | `ModelEventMap` | `load(name, count)` · `link(key, relation)` · `unlink(key, relation)` |

`load` fires ONCE per relation an eager-load resolves (`load` / `find`, including each nested relation) — carrying the relation name + the COUNT of related rows attached across the whole record set (the batched load has no N+1, and neither do its events — it is not one event per record); `link` / `unlink` fire after a junction row is inserted / removed, carrying the owning key + the relation name. Reads of the base rows are the table's concern (observe `model.table.emitter` for per-row `write` / `remove`).

**The listener-isolation safety guarantee.** A listener throw is NEVER allowed to escape into the load: the emitter isolates it and routes it to its OWN `error` handler (the `error` option, surfaced as `(error, event)`), NOT to a domain event — so a buggy observer is isolated yet not silently lost. The `error` handler runs in its own try/catch, so even a throwing handler can't recurse or escape; with no handler, the throw is swallowed silently. Because every emit sits after its transition AND is isolated, a buggy observer **cannot corrupt the batched eager-load or a junction write** — the load still resolves correctly and the junction row is still written — proven by the emit-safety tests. (A `Model` is reached via the `RelationManager`, which does not thread an `error` handler to it, so a `Model` listener throw is swallowed silently.)

### Practices

- **Define all related models up front** — nested includes resolve through the registry, so a relation you want to nest-load must have its own entry.
- **Use the builders** — `belongsTo` / `hasMany` / `hasOne` / `hasThrough` / `hasMorph` set an explicit `relationship`; the string / array shorthands are unambiguous, but a raw `{ key }` resolves to `one`.
- **Reach for typed CRUD through `model.table`** — the table is fully typed; relation loading is the looser layer on top.
- **Request only the relations you use** — each included relation is one extra query.
- **Use `link` / `unlink` / `links` for `through` joins** rather than writing junction rows by hand.
- **Observe, don't drive** — subscribe to `model.emitter` (`load` / `link` / `unlink`) for metrics or a sync layer (see [Observing](#observing)); emitting is a pure side-channel, so a listener never changes what a load does (and a throwing one can't corrupt it).
